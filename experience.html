    <h1>Economic Development Corporation - Grand Traverse Resort and Casinos, Traverse City - IT Intern</h1>
    <p>June 2017 - August 2018</p>
    <p>I began working for Grand Traverse Resort and Casinos (GTRC) as an IT
      Intern in June of 2017, and left the organization to attend the University
      of Michigan in the fall of 2018. With GTRC, a large portion of my job was
      to provide level 1 support to end-users. This included answering help-desk
      calls, creating and responding to help-desk tickets, troubleshooting
      basic computer hardware, software, printer problems, and unlocking
      accounts and resetting passwords in Microsoft Active Directory and IBM
      iSeries. In addition to providing level 1 support, I worked under our
      network administrator to implement company-wide projects. I made a
      significant contribution to a large project that deployed centralized
      print services to 930 PCs for 100 printers. A part of that project
      included auditing every machine on the domain for unsupported
      software and verifying the status of installed applications.
      I was also able to receive training on the creation of group
      policies and OUs in Microsoft Active Directory during this project. For
      another project, I assisted the telecommunications team in upgrading the
      phone system from Nortel CS1000 to the Avaya IPOffice. My contributions
      included flashing the firmware of the phones, installing and setting up
      the phones, and providing training to users to operate new features of
      the phone. </p>
    <h2>CARE Action!</h2>
    <p>Novermber 2017 - Present</p>
    <p>I am a volunteer advocate for CARE Action! During my time with CARE,
    I have conducted meetings with representatives and senators from Michigan
    in-district and in Washington DC to advocate for USAID funding, the Global
    Food Security Act, and the International Violence Against Women Act. </p>

    <h3>Northwestern Michigan College, Traverse City - Office Assistant</h3>
    <p>August 2014 - August 2015</p>
    <p>
   While working at Northwestern Michigan College’s (NMC) Foundation, I made
   solicitation calls, and calls to thank donors for their contributions.
   I would make these phone calls on a consistent basis to build rapport with donors.
   I also used these communication skills in person at some of the events that
   I worked at, such as NMC’s scholarship luncheon. At the luncheon, I lead
   students and donors to different activities, managed their involvement with
   the activities on social media, and connected with students and donors. In my
   everyday work environment at NMC’s Foundation, I did not simply work under one
   superior. Instead, I helped the entire team, taking projects from multiple superiors.
   This environment helped build my communication skills and work effectively and
   efficiently in a team. This job required professionalism, and pleasant
   communication with others.</p>
